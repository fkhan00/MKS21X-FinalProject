# MKS21X-FinalProject
For my final project, I created an interface where the user can play sudoku. The user can add and remove items and have the option to throw in the towel and be given the solution to the sudoku puzzle.You can also get hints from Sudoku.java by pressing h and it will five you the number at the slot you're on. The program generates a sudoku puzzle for the user so no need for sudoku text files. 
To download the project, you need to download the following files from the demo commit: lanterna.jar, Sudoku.java, Block.java., Grid.java, and Generator.java.
