# MKS21X-FinalProject
For my final project, I created an interface where the user can play sudoku. The user can add and remove items and have the option to throw in the towel and be given the solution to the sudoku puzzle. The program will also take your name and the time taken to complete the sudoku puzzle and tweet it at the twitter account PsuedoSudoKhan. The user is given a menu where they can choose their difficulty level and the program will then read in a random text file of that difficulty.  
To download the project, you need to download the following files from the demo commit: lanterna.jar, Sudoku.java, Block.java., Grid.java, and jar:twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar. You also need to download the nine sudoku text files into the same directory as the other files.
To compile: javac -cp lanterna.jar:twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar: Sudoku.java
To run: java -cp lanterna.jar:twitter4j-core-4.0.7.jar: Sudoku
