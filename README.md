# MKS21X-Final_Project
For my final project, I created an interface where the user can play sudoku. The user can add and remove items and upload sudoku text files to play on. 
To download the project, you need to download the following into the same directory: Sudoku.java, Grid.java, Block.java, and Lanterna.jar
You also need to download the sudoku text file SM3.txt which is in the main branch. This will be used for the demo.
